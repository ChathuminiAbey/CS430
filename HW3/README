	3. A pbm file will be created
 
I was unable to get certain ppm files to be perfect, some have a white or black line from here and there where it's not supposed to be. I tried to troubleshoot this issue, but was unable to find a solution. I will continue to troubleshoot so it is fixed by the next assignment.
